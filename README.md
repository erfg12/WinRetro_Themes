<details>
  
  <summary>LEGACY SYSTEM TRAY ICONS</summary>

- Download CustomizerGod from [door2windows.com](http://www.door2windows.com/). Install it.
**For Windows 10 builds below 1903.**
1. Run the "CustomizerGod.exe" program. Select the "Volume Icons" on the left menu.
2. Select the icon, click the Replace button. Navigate to the "System Icons" folder. Select "kcmsound.png" or "audio-volume-muted.png"
3. Select the "Network Icons" on the left menu.
4. Select the icon, click the Replace button. Navigate to the "System Icons" folder. Select "notification-network-wireless.png".
5. You can replace any other system icons here as well.

**For Windows 10 builds above 1903. (untested, found on forums)**
- The network icons in the pnidue.dll file is still located in system32, so Customizer God works as-is for changing those.
- If you want to change the volume icons, copy the SndVolSSO.dll.mun file from the SystemResources folder to another directory. Open the copied file with CustomizerGod using the "Open File" button. Make sure to change the option so it can see all files. Once selected you can change the icons like normal. Repeat the same process for any other .dll.mun files you want to change.
- Now you need to overwrite the files in the SystemResources folder with the newly modified ones. Boot into Hiren's BootCD. Simple click and drag to overwrite, then restart.

### TROUBLESHOOTING 
**Q)** "CustomizerGod.exe" gives me an error about a permissions issue on a .dll file. <br>
**A)** Navigate to that .dll file, right click on it, select the Security tab, and give all permissions to all groups.

**Q)** How do I remove the theme? <br>
**A)** Run the Remove_Theme.bat file located in your `%userprofile%\documents\Themes\` directory
